Transaction Data Services (TDS) 
=======================================

The TDS is a suite of business services that provides access to IR customers transaction data for consumption by software packages.  In turn these packages present that data to their users. 
Financial transaction data includes amounts assessed and associated credits or debits.  There is no data sent associated with the details of how an assessment has been calculated
